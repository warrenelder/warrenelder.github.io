My name is Warren Elder and I'm interested in collecting and analysing data to gain a better understanding of the world around us. I am always curious, and get excited when challenged with a new problem to solve or technology to master.

My educational background is in Physics, and was fortunate to study this field to postgraduate level, securing a {% link PhD https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/9816 [https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/9816] [Semi-empirical modelling of SiGe hetero-structures] %} in Semiconductor Device Modelling from Imperial College London. I was also involved in subsequent projects as a researcher looking at optimising the optoelectronic properties in Silicon based optoelectronic devices. This involved using both advanced analytical techniques to characterise our bespoke nano-structured-devices and the creation of models that describe how they interact with light.

More recently I have worked as an applications developer in Oxford at Global Initiative Ltd. As a company we specialised in assisting the development of products in early stage startups. As a result, I have worked on innovative projects in areas such as digital health, home energy management, finance, wearables and the internet of things.

Some fun projects I have been involved in include;

**Biometric monitoring of elderly people at home to support and inform health care professionals and carers.**
Working with the University of Warwick we were tasked with retrieving and preparing data from *FitBit* and Samsung *SmartThings* devices for analysis. Then a patients analysed data was converted into graphical form in an easy to understand and interpret web based dashboard for healthcare professionals to view.

**Home energy management product- Loop.**
{% link Loop https://www.loopenergysaver.com/ [https://www.loopenergysaver.com/] %} records electricity and gas usage in your home and transmits to a receiver connected to the internet via a router. This data is then analysed and shared back through a web application to provide insight on how to improve energy efficiency and save money. I mainly worked on the *saving money* bit by interfacing with USwitch API (this provided energy tariffs for all of the UK based energy suppliers) and determining if a user was getting the best deal based on their real time energy usage.

**InkPath, a skills tracking application for universities and higher education.**
Using the hybrid app platform *Ionic*, a phone app was created that synced with a bespoke REST API. {% link Inkpath https://www.inkpath.co.uk/ [https://www.inkpath.co.uk/] %} allows university administrators specify skills and courses for enrolled students who search, view and attend these courses through use of the phone app. The exciting part of this project is the premise, that by the end of a university education a student can expect to have pre-formed, highly detailed, university validated, Curriculum Vitae to their name.

I currently live in sunny Auckland, New Zealand, having recently moved from Oxford, England. My current focus is on expanding my expertise in data science. Iâ€™m always open to chatting about new projects or finding ways to contribute, so don't hesitate about getting in-touch, it would be great to hear from you.
