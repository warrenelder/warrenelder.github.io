Welcome.

This is my first post and I thought I should start by addressing the question, "Why am I here"? Well to answer this, I should probably also ask the question, "Who am I, who is asking this question?". Thinking about it further, I could maybe then ask, "who do I want to answer these questions?"...

Now before going on and confusing my metaphysical self in a way Douglas Adams would approve of, I really just wanted to share the purpose of this site with myself and the reader (if your not me!).

So if the answer to the second question is, "I'm Warren Elder" i.e me, then I can answer the first question as; "I'm here to explain, store and recall information from the world of data science and technology..." and that, "I feel the best way to do all this is to share this information with others so they can be informed and engaged in the same way I have been." Otherwise, if the answer is, "I'm not Warren Elder", then the answer to the first question is probably, "a mistake!", but hopefully if you take a quick peak around then you might find something that would have made your journey worth while. And if not, then I recommend having a read of the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy instead, as it will probably make more sense.
